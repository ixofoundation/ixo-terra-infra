## What This Project Provides

This infrastructure stack automatically deploys and manages:

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Multi-cloud support (Vultr VKE or AWS EKS)
- **GitOps Deployment**: ArgoCD for automated application deployment
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki for metrics and logging
- **Security & Authentication**: Vault for secrets management, Dex for OAuth
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL clusters with automated backups
- **Networking**: Ingress controllers, DNS management, VPN access
- **Additional Services**: Matrix chat, Ghost CMS, Uptime monitoring

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
Install these tools on your development machine:

1. **Terraform CLI** (v1.0+)
   - Download from: https://terraform.io/downloads
   - Verify installation: `terraform --version`

2. **kubectl** (Kubernetes CLI)
   - Download from: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
   - Used to interact with your Kubernetes cluster

3. **Git**
   - For cloning repositories and GitOps workflows

### Required Third-Party Accounts

You'll need accounts with the following services:

#### Essential Services
1. **Cloud Provider** (choose one):
   - **Vultr**: For VKE (Vultr Kubernetes Engine) - Recommended for simplicity
   - **AWS**: For EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) - More enterprise features

2. **GitHub**:
   - Used for OAuth authentication and storing your configuration repositories
   - You'll need to create OAuth Apps for ArgoCD and Vault integration

#### Optional Services (depending on features you enable)
3. **Google Cloud Platform**:
   - Required for Vault auto-unsealing and storage backups
   - Create a service account with appropriate permissions

4. **Cloudflare**:
   - For DNS management (if using external-dns with Cloudflare)
   - Alternative to manual DNS configuration

5. **Tailscale**:
   - For secure VPN access to your cluster
   - Create OAuth credentials for Kubernetes integration

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ixo-terra-infra

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init
```

### 2. Estimate Costs First

**Important**: Before deploying, run cost estimates to understand your monthly expenses:

```bash
# Make cost estimation script executable
chmod +x estimate-costs.sh

# Estimate costs for your development environment
./estimate-costs.sh your_dev_env

# For detailed cost breakdowns, see:
# - README-cost-estimation.md (how to run estimates)
# - README-vultr-cost-estimates.md (detailed pricing)
```

### 3. Create Your Configuration

**Important**: Don't use the existing `terraform.tfvars` file directly - it's configured for our specific infrastructure. Instead, create your own configuration files:

```bash
# Create your own variables file
cp terraform.tfvars my-infrastructure.tfvars
# OR use the quickstart example
cp quickstart.tfvars my-infrastructure.tfvars

# Edit the file with your specific configuration
nano my-infrastructure.tfvars
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Set these environment variables before running Terraform:

#### Essential Variables
```bash
# Your cloud provider API key
export TF_VAR_vultr_api_key="your-vultr-api-key"
# OR for AWS:
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret-key"

# Vault master password (choose a strong password)
export TERRAFORM_VAULT_PASSWORD="your-secure-vault-password"
```

#### OAuth Configuration (for authentication)
```bash
# GitHub OAuth for ArgoCD (create at: https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
export TF_VAR_oidc_argo='{"clientId": "your-github-app-client-id", "clientSecret": "your-github-app-secret"}'

# GitHub OAuth for Vault (create a separate GitHub OAuth app)
export TF_VAR_oidc_vault='{"clientId": "your-vault-github-client-id", "clientSecret": "your-vault-github-secret"}'
```

#### Optional Variables
```bash
# Tailscale OAuth (if enabling Tailscale VPN)
export TF_VAR_oidc_tailscale='{"clientId": "your-tailscale-client-id", "clientSecret": "your-tailscale-secret"}'

# Cloudflare API token (if using Cloudflare DNS)
export TF_VAR_cloudflare_api_token="your-cloudflare-token"
```

### 5. Understanding Environment Configuration

This project uses a flexible environment system defined in `variables.tf`. Each environment (dev, staging, prod, etc.) can have different services enabled or disabled.

> **Environment Naming**: You can use any environment names that make sense for your organization (e.g., `companyname_dev`, `staging`, `production`, etc.). The examples below use generic names, but you'll see IXO-specific names (`devnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet`) in our configuration as reference.

#### How `var.environments` Works

In your `.tfvars` file, you define environments like this:

```hcl
# First, define your domain mappings
domains = {
  yourdomain = "yourdomain.com"     # Your primary domain
  secondary  = "secondary.com"      # Optional secondary domain
}

environments = {
  "your_dev" = {                    # Use your own naming convention
    cluster_firewall = true
    aws_region      = "us-west-2"   # or your preferred AWS region
    aws_iam_users   = []            # List of AWS IAM users for this environment
    rpc_url         = "https://dev.yourdomain.com/rpc/"
    ipfs_service_mapping = "https://ipfs.yourdomain.com"
    is_development  = true          # Optional: enables development-specific settings
    
    # AWS VPC configuration
    aws_vpc_config = {
      nat_gateway_enabled = false   # Set to true for production
      flow_logs_enabled = false     # Set to true for production
      retention_days = 7            # Log retention period
      az_count = 2                  # Number of availability zones
    }
    
    # Hyperlane configuration (if using cross-chain features)
    hyperlane = {
      chain_names     = [""]        # Your chain identifiers
      metadata_chains = [""]        # Metadata chain identifiers
    }
    
    # Enable/disable and configure services for this environment

        storage_class = "bulk"      # Use cheaper storage
        storage_size = "40Gi"       # Storage allocation
      }
      
      # ... more services as needed
    }

}
```

#### Key Configuration Options

**Per-Environment Settings:**
- `cluster_firewall`: Enable/disable cluster firewall protection
- `aws_region`: AWS region for resources (if using AWS)
- `aws_iam_users`: List of IAM users with access to this environment
- `is_development`: Boolean flag that enables development-specific optimizations
  - Reduces resource requirements

- `aws_vpc_config`: VPC networking configuration
- `hyperlane`: Cross-chain bridge configuration

**Per-Service Settings:**
- `enabled`: Whether to deploy this service in this environment
- `domain`: Which domain mapping to use (references `domains` at top of file)
- `dns_endpoint`: Complete custom URL (e.g., "api.yourdomain.com")
- `dns_prefix`: Prefix to add to domain (e.g., "api" creates "api.yourdomain.com")
- `storage_class`: Storage type ("standard", "fast", "bulk")
- `storage_size`: Storage allocation (e.g., "40Gi", "100Gi")

#### Available Services

### 6. Deploy Your Infrastructure

```bash
# Create or select workspace (environment) - use your own naming
terraform workspace new your_dev_env
# OR
terraform workspace select your_dev_env

# Plan your deployment
terraform plan -var-file="my-infrastructure.tfvars"

# Apply the changes
terraform apply -var-file="my-infrastructure.tfvars"
```

### 7. Post-Deployment Configuration

After successful deployment, you may need to configure:

#### Google Cloud Platform (if using GCP features)
- Upload your GCP service account key as `gcp-key-secret` in the appropriate namespace
- The key should have permissions for KMS and Cloud Storage

#### Vault Configuration
- A userpass auth method with username `Terraform` needs to be created manually (this will be automated in future)
- Apply the policy from `config/vault/terraform_policy_manual.hcl`
- This allows Terraform to manage Vault resources

#### DNS Configuration
- If not using external-dns, manually configure DNS records to point to your load balancer
- Check the ingress controller service for the external IP

## Customization

### Adding New Services

To add a new service:

1. Create a new module in `modules.tf`
2. Add the service to the `application_configs` in your environment
3. Create appropriate Helm values in `config/helm-values/`

### Environment-Specific Configuration

Each environment can have different:
- Cloud providers
- Resource sizes
- Enabled services
- DNS configurations
- Security settings

### Multi-Environment Setup

You can manage multiple environments from the same Terraform configuration:

```bash
# Development environment
terraform workspace select your_dev
terraform apply -var-file="your-dev.tfvars"

# Production environment  
terraform workspace select your_prod
terraform apply -var-file="your-prod.tfvars"
```

## Cleanup

To remove all infrastructure:

```bash
terraform workspace select your-environment
terraform destroy -var-file="my-infrastructure.tfvars"
```

**Warning**: This will permanently delete all resources. Make sure you have backups of any important data.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**: Verify your API keys and OAuth configuration
2. **Resource Limits**: Check your cloud provider account limits
3. **DNS Issues**: Ensure DNS records are properly configured
4. **Service Dependencies**: Some services depend on others (e.g., applications need ArgoCD)

### Getting Help

- Check Terraform logs: `terraform apply` with `-v` flag for verbose output
- Verify Kubernetes cluster: `kubectl get nodes`
- Check ArgoCD applications: Access ArgoCD UI to see deployment status

## Security Notes

- Store sensitive variables in environment variables, not in `.tfvars` files
- Use strong passwords for Vault and other services
- Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
- Enable only the services you need for each environment
- Consider using private repositories for your customized configuration
