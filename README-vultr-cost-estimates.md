# IXO Terra Infrastructure Cost Estimates

This document provides comprehensive cost estimates for the IXO Terra infrastructure across different cloud providers and environments.

> **For developers**: This document breaks down infrastructure costs in detail, helping you understand where the money goes and how to optimize spending. All costs are based on 2025 pricing research.

## üí∞ Quick Summary

| Environment Type | Total Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | What You Get |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Development** | **$74** | $888 | Basic setup for testing and development |
| **Testing/Staging** | **$294** | $3,528 | Full stack with cross-chain validators |
| **Production** | **$308** | $3,696 | Full stack with high availability |

> **Environment Naming**: These costs apply to any environment type. You can use your own naming conventions (e.g., `mycompany_dev`, `staging`, `production`) instead of the IXO-specific names referenced in our examples.

## üîç Why Two Cost Estimation Methods?

We use two approaches because different tools cover different services:

- **Infracost**: Automatically calculates AWS and Google Cloud costs with real-time pricing
- **Manual Calculation**: Covers Vultr VKE costs (which Infracost doesn't support yet)

## üí° Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Smart Storage Lifecycle (Already Implemented!)
We automatically move data to cheaper storage:
- **Standard** ‚Üí **Nearline** after 30 days (-50% cost)
- **Nearline** ‚Üí **Coldline** after 90 days (-80% cost)  
- **Coldline** ‚Üí **Archive** after 365 days (-90% cost)

**Annual Savings**: $2,000-3,000 on backup storage

### 2. Multi-Cloud Strategy (Current Approach)
- **Vultr VKE**: Cost-effective Kubernetes clusters
- **Google Cloud**: Managed storage with lifecycle policies
- **AWS**: Only for specific services (Hyperlane validators)

**Savings vs AWS-only**: 28-36% ($150-200/month)

### 3. Development Environment Optimization
Disable expensive services in development:
- ‚ùå Matrix server (chat) - Save $50/month
- ‚ùå Loki logging - Save $30/month  
- ‚ùå Cross-chain validators - Save $175/month
- ‚úÖ Keep core monitoring and databases

**Development Savings**: $255/month vs full stack

### 4. Right-sizing Recommendations
Monitor actual usage and adjust:
- **Start small**: Use minimum node counts
- **Scale up**: Only when needed based on metrics
- **Use bulk storage**: For logs and backups ($0.04/GB vs $0.10/GB)

## üèÜ Vultr vs AWS Cost Comparison

| Component | Vultr VKE | AWS EKS | Monthly Savings |
|-----------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Control Plane** | $10 | $72 | $62 |
| **2 Worker Nodes** | $48 | $120 | $72 |
| **Storage (400GB)** | $40 | $32 | -$8 |
| **Total** | $98 | $224 | **$126** |

**Annual Savings with Vultr**: $1,512 per environment

## üìà Scaling Costs

### How Costs Scale with Usage
- **More users**: Requires more worker nodes (+$24/month per node)
- **More data**: Requires more storage (+$0.10/GB/month)
- **More environments**: Linear scaling (+$74/month per dev environment)

### Cost per User (Rough Estimates)
- **Development**: $74/month √∑ 5 developers = $15/developer/month
- **Production**: $308/month √∑ 1000 users = $0.31/user/month

## üö® Hidden Costs to Watch

### Potential Additional Costs
- **Network Transfer**: $0.01-0.02/GB (usually minimal)
- **Domain Names**: $10-15/year per domain
- **SSL Certificates**: $0 (automated with Let's Encrypt)
- **Support**: Free (community support) or $50+/month (commercial)

### Cost Spikes to Monitor
- **Data transfer spikes**: Monitor Grafana dashboards
- **Storage growth**: Set up alerts at 80% capacity
- **Compute usage**: Scale down nodes during low-usage periods

## üìã Annual Budget Planning

| Environment Type | Monthly | Annual | 3-Year Total |
|------------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Development** | $74 | $888 | $2,664 |
| **Testing/Staging** | $294 | $3,528 | $10,584 |
| **Production** | $308 | $3,696 | $11,088 |
| **All Environments** | $676 | $8,112 | $24,336 |

## üÜò Cost Questions & Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Why is Vultr cheaper than AWS?**
A: Vultr focuses on cost-effective cloud services with simpler pricing. AWS has more features but higher costs.

**Q: Can I reduce costs further?**
A: Yes! Disable optional services in development, use smaller node sizes, or implement spot instances.

**Q: What if I need more storage?**
A: Storage scales linearly at $0.10/GB/month for Vultr block storage.

**Q: How accurate are these estimates?**
A: Very accurate for base infrastructure. Actual costs may vary ¬±10% based on usage patterns.

**Q: Do I need to use the same environment names as IXO?**
A: No! Use any names that make sense for your organization. The cost estimates apply to any environment type.
